# Bosch-Production-Line-Performance - Big Data Project
## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for the [Bosch Production Line Performance competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/overview) organized in 2016. The main challenge of this project revolved around handling an imbalanced dataset with millions of records. To streamline the preprocessing, analysis, and model creation, I focused solely on the numeric dataset, opting not to use all three datasets provided.

I have utilized PySpark, primarily designed for handling large-scale datasets, in conjunction with the Pandas library to analyze and construct machine learning models.
